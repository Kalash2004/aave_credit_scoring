# aave_credit_scoring
This internship project builds an explainable "credit scoring" model for Aave V2 protocol users, using only on-chain transaction data. Each wallet is scored (0–1000) based on behavioral patterns — more responsible usage yields a higher score; risky/bot-like usage yields a lower score.
